# Apache Spark Repository Has Moved

[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) is now an incubator 
[Apache](http://www.apache.org) project, and we've moved the codebase.

Spark is now [mirrored on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/spark) 
at the following repository location:

    git clone git://github.com/apache/spark.git
    
    
    ### make some changes
    
    ### optimizing the features
    
    
    ### adding new features..

Other information including documentation is available on the Spark website: 
[http://spark.apache.org/](http://spark.apache.org/)

Thanks!
